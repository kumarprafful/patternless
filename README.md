# Patternless

For now this a React design pattern in making. Once I have a few components made I will publish this on NPM.

Components working: -
### <Button>Button<Button>

> #### props
>
> - children
> - background
> - color
> - borderColor
> - uppercase
> - round
> - outline
> - raise
> - fontWeight
> - boxShadow
